2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
LUTAR-1#1 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell btnDebounce_L/xpos_reg[6]_i_3, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous reset pin(s) xpos_reg[0]/CLR, xpos_reg[1]/CLR, xpos_reg[2]/CLR, xpos_reg[3]/CLR, xpos_reg[4]/CLR, xpos_reg[5]/CLR, xpos_reg[6]/CLR. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

LUTAR-1#2 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell btnDebounce_U/ypos_reg[7]_i_3, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous reset pin(s) ypos_reg[0]/CLR, ypos_reg[4]/CLR, ypos_reg[5]/CLR, ypos_reg[6]/CLR, ypos_reg[7]/CLR. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
